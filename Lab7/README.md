Complete the following tasks:

Task 1
Go to Exercise 1 and find task 1. Now, change the activation function and other parameters such as optimizer to see the effect on the network and it's performance. If possible create a grid search.

Task 2
Go to Exercise2_DogvsCat_CNN and find task 2. We have used Dropout to enhance the performance of the CNN model. Can you please use whatever you like to further enhance the performance from val_acc: 0.7506 to above?

Task 3
Please consider this Time Series Prediction with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks. We can see that the LSTM model in the Exercise 3 has an average error of about 23 passengers (in thousands) on the training dataset, and about 53 passengers (in thousands) on the test dataset. Not that bad. Can you please improve the performance?
